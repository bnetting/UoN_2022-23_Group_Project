Given the two tables, the countermeasures needs to be tabulated in the following way:

Countermeasure	E_Alpha	    E_Beta      E_Gamma     E_Delta	    Cost
A	            0.8 	    0	        0	        0	        500
B	            0.25	    0.65	    0	        0	        400
C 	            0	        0.75	    0.4	        0.05	    750
D	            0	        0	        0	        0.4	        100

Where E_x is the effectiveness of the countermeasure against the threat "x"
